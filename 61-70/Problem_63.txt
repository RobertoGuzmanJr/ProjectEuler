SOLUTION

We want to know how many instances exist where:

x^N = M and the number of digits in M is N.

Another way to say that the number of digits in M is N is to say that:

(N-1) <= LOG10(M) < N

But we have that

N*LOG10(x) = LOG10(M)

So that:

(N-1) <= N*LOG10(x) < N
-->

(N-1)/N <= LOG10(x) < 1 --> 1-(1/N) <= LOG10(x) < 1

Now, the right hand side gives us that x must be less than 10. So possible
values for x are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9.

To solve, simply calculate the LOG10 for each of these. Then evaluate the 
inequality for values of N >= 1 and see which ones it holds for. The sum is
your answer!
