Let the outer nodes be denoted X1, X2, X3, X4, and X5, where X1 is the node at 1 o clock.
Then, the remaining nodes can be labeled clockwise, starting at noon, as X6, X7, X8, X9, X10.

This means that if designate a sum, S, then we have the following equations that must hold for all final assignments:

X1 + X7 + X8 = S
X2 + X8 + X9 = S
X3 + X9 + X10 = S
X4 + X10 + X6 = S
X5 + X6 + X7 = S

We also get the following "candidate chains." If X1 is the smallest of the outer set, then the number will be:

X1_X7_X8_X2_X8_X9_X3_X9_X10_X4_X10_X6_X5_X6_X7

if X2 is the smallest, then the first three digits are permuted to the end:

X2_X8_X9_X3_X9_X10_X4_X10_X6_X5_X6_X7_X1_X7_X8

if X3 is the smallest:

X3_X9_X10_X4_X10_X6_X5_X6_X7_X1_X7_X8_X2_X8_X9

if X4:

X4_X10_X6_X5_X6_X7_X1_X7_X8_X2_X8_X9_X3_X9_X10

if X5:

X5_X6_X7_X1_X7_X8_X2_X8_X9_X3_X9_X10_X4_X10_X6

Since we are combining 15 nodes to give us our final number and we want a 16 digit number, it means that 10 must be assigned to one of the outer nodes, since they each appear only once. Since this is symmetric, we should be able to assign X1 = 10 and keep that permanent. From there, we can examine the possibilities with a for loop.

Once we have a combination that works, we identify the smallest of the 5 outer nodes and then append the number chain that is based on it to the list of candidates.
