For the numbers 1 to 20, this is actually quite easy and we will not need to use a computer program to find the result! Consider that the primes that are less than or equal to 20 are 2,3,5,7,11,13,17, and 19. As a result, we know that the minimum exponent on each of these numbers is 1. On the other hand, some numbers less than 20 will have more than 1 multiple of some of these primes. Since 5^2 = 25 > 20, we know that no number less than 20 can have more than 1 factor of 5. This same reasoning applies to all the primes larger than 5, so we can keep all such primes with exponents of 1. For the primes smaller than 5 (2 and 3), we can see that the largest power of 2 is 4 (since 2^4 = 16 and 2^5 = 32) and the largest power of 3 is 2 (since 3^2 = 9 and 3^3 = 27). Thus, our result can be calculated as follows:

2^4*3^2*5*7*11*13*17*19 = 232,792,560
